# Connectomix Configuration: Seed-to-Voxel with External Seeds TSV File
# 
# This configuration demonstrates seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis
# with seeds loaded from an external TSV file.
#
# Usage:
#   connectomix /path/to/bids /path/to/output participant --config seed_to_voxel_from_file.yaml

# BIDS Entity Filters
# ==================
# Filter which data to process from your BIDS dataset

subject: ["01", "02"]              # Subject IDs (without "sub-" prefix)
tasks: ["rest"]                    # Task names
sessions: null                     # Session IDs (null = all sessions)
runs: null                         # Run numbers (null = all runs)
spaces: ["MNI152NLin2009cAsym"]   # MNI spaces to use

# Analysis Method
# ===============
method: "seedToVoxel"

# Seeds Configuration
# ===================
# OPTION: Load seeds from external TSV file
# The TSV file must have columns: name, x, y, z (tab-separated)
seeds_file: "seeds.tsv"            # Path to seeds TSV file (relative or absolute)

# Seed Parameters
radius: 5.0                        # Sphere radius in mm (default: 5.0)

# Denoised Data Location
# ======================
denoised_derivatives: null         # Path to denoised data (if not using --derivatives flag)

# Output Options
# ==============
label: null                        # Custom label for output filenames (optional)

# Connectivity Computation
# ========================
connectivity_kind: "correlation"   # Type of connectivity measure

# Temporal Censoring (Optional)
# =============================
# Uncomment to enable condition-based analysis or motion censoring
condition_masking:
  enabled: false
  # events_file: "auto"           # Auto-detect from BIDS, or provide explicit path
  # conditions: ["rest"]           # Condition names to include (empty = all)
  # transition_buffer: 0.0         # Seconds to exclude around boundaries
  # min_volumes_retained: 50       # Minimum volumes required
  # min_fraction_retained: 0.3     # Minimum fraction of volumes

# Advanced Options (Usually not needed)
# ======================================
# n_components: 20                 # For CanICA (not used in seedToVoxel)
# canica_threshold: 1.0            # For CanICA (not used in seedToVoxel)
# canica_min_region_size: 50       # For CanICA (not used in seedToVoxel)
